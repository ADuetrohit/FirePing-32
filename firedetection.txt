Project Title: FirePulse 32 – ESP32-Based Fire Detection System with Buzzer & Telegram Alerts

Overview:
FirePulse 32 is a compact and efficient fire detection system that uses an ESP32 microcontroller, IR flame sensor, buzzer, and BC547 transistor for switching. In addition to local audio alerts, the system sends real-time Telegram messages to notify users remotely when a flame is detected. This project is ideal for safety monitoring in homes, labs, workshops, or small industrial setups.

System Functionality:

The IR flame sensor detects the presence of fire or flame by sensing infrared light.
The output signal from the sensor is read by the ESP32, which processes the input in real time.


When fire is detected:
The buzzer is activated via the BC547 transistor, which acts as a switch to handle higher current for the buzzer.
A Telegram message is sent instantly using the Telegram Bot API, alerting the user on their phone or PC.
The system is modular and can be extended with other features like IoT dashboards, SMS alerts, or integration with home automation platforms.
